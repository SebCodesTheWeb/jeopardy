# jeopardy
My school in Sweden(procivitas.se) is holding a Jeopady competition for their faculty and students. I have helped by making this program,
that takes in a number of teams. The different team names are then mapped onto specific keys:

team 1 - up arrow key

team 2 - down arrow key

team 3 - left arrow key

team 4 - right arrow key

team 5 - w key

team 6 - s key

team 7 - a key

team 8 - d key

This specific keys are then mapped onto the buttons, to time who presses first.
